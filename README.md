# tor-bulk-exit-list
A Perl automation script for downloading the official Tor Bulk Exit List, comparing with previous lists and creating/updating iptables rules for blocking incoming connections from IPv4 Tor exit nodes (currently, the official bulk exit list or 'CollecTor' metrics do not provide details on IPv6 addressses).
